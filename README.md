## Objective

- To create, deploy, and monitor a risk assessment ML model that will estimate the attrition risk of each of the company's 10,000 clients. 
- If the deployed model is accurate, it will enable the client managers to contact the clients with the highest risk and avoid losing clients and revenue.
- As the industry is dynamic and constantly changing regular monitoring of the created model is setup to ensure that it remains accurate and up-to-date. This includes:
---
seting up processes and scripts to `re-train`, `re-deploy`, `monitor`, and `report` on the ML model, so that an accurate -as possible- risk assessments is obtained and an overall minimization of client attrition is achieved.

## Steps

**1. Data Ingestion**

Creating a script that's flexible enough to work with constantly changing sets of input files instead of using a single, static dataset.

In this step, you'll read data files into Python, and write them to an output file that will be your master dataset. You'll also save a record of the files you've read.
- Automatically checking a database for new data that can be used for model training.
- Compiling all training data to a training dataset and saving it to persistent storage. 
- Writing metrics related to the completed data ingestion tasks to persistent storage.

**2. Training, scoring, and deploying**

- Writing scripts that train an ML model that predicts attrition risk, and scoring the model. 
- Writing the model and the scoring metrics to persistent storage.

**3. Diagnostics**

- Determining and saving summary statistics related to a dataset. 
- Timing the performance of model training and scoring scripts. 
- Checking for dependency changes and package updates.

**4. Reporting**

- Automatically generating plots and documents that report on model metrics. 
- Providing an API endpoint that can return model predictions and metrics.

**5. Process Automation**

- Creating a script and cron job that automatically run all previous steps at regular intervals.
